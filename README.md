# Console-finances

Financial data analysis completed using JavaScript.

## Description

This project is a Javascript code written to analyse the financial records of a company. It uses a dataset in the form of a multidimensional array containing a company's monthly revenue, which can be found in the JavaScript file.

The code calculates the number of months the data was collected over, the net profit over this time period, the average change in profit/loss over the period, and the month that saw the greatest increase in profit month-on-month, as well as the greatest decrease in profit (i.e. loss).

The project was a good opportunity to practice applying the JavaScript skills learnt in Week 4 of the Front-End Web Development bootcamp and begin thinking in a logical way to solve problems using code. This was my first encounter with multidimensional arrays, which required additional logical thinking and problem solving.

Solving the challenge required use of 'for' loops and mathematics to compare values within the array, and update variables accordingly. A new array was then created to concatenate the results and display them clearly. The .toLocaleString function also came in handy to correctly format the results and make them as legible as possible.
